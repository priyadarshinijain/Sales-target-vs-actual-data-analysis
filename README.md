# Sales-target-vs-actual-data-analysis

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, focusing on various metrics related to targets and actual sales.

Technical Insights:
Variance Analysis: The dashboard emphasizes the variance between actual and target sales, which is a vital KPI for assessing sales team performance. This helps in identifying the teams and individuals that need support to meet goals.

Trends Over Time: The line charts show how each salesperson's actual sales have fluctuated over time, helping managers analyze performance trends and determine where intervention may be needed.

Data Aggregation: The dashboard clearly aggregates data across multiple teams and salespeople, allowing for both granular and high-level views. The visualizations enable quick insight into both overall and individual performance.

Predictive and Historical Data: The data spans over a year, providing insights into historical performance and potentially guiding future sales strategies.

Customization and Filtering: Users can likely filter and drill down into the data (e.g., by salesperson or team), which allows for a detailed performance review across different dimensions (teams, individuals, and time periods).

This dashboard appears to be a powerful tool for monitoring, analyzing, and improving sales performance within an organization. The ability to compare actual sales to targets, monitor variances, and analyze individual performance helps drive data-driven decisions.
